Allegiance of the Damned mod for Total War: Warhammer III.

## Introduction

This mod allows Chaos factions to confederate via domination, using the same feature already existent with the 
Greenskins. It is designed following loreful rules, so champions can only confederate each other if they follow the same
god. Only exceptions are Archaon, who can confederate all mortal, and Be'lakor and Daniel, who can confederate all
daemons.
